Setting Up Snowball
========================================================

You must download the plugin first. Once your plugin is
located in your plugin folder, then you must setup gulp.

========================================================
Setting Up Gulp
========================================================
You must have npm(Node Package Manager) installed first,
which is part of Node.js.

Check out https://nodejs.org/ to install Nodejs.

You should have a package.json file in your directory
when you retrieve this repository.

Entering:
npm install

will automatically install all the dependencies you need.
If that DOESN'T WORK: try the steps below.

Once that is done, install gulp globally using npm by:
npm install -g gulp 

After it is globally installed, then install locally 
to your project with:
npm install --save-dev gulp

then install each plugin needed using:
npm install --save-dev plugin-name

The list of packages should be listed in packages.json


========================================================
Running Gulp
========================================================
NOTE: 
You must run gulp to minify the files that need to be
because the changes that happen will not be sent since
the server is sending the minified version.

Also leaving gulp running will automatically minify
the files you edit.
========================================================
Instructions:

After you installed gulp, there should be a gulpfile.js
file that has the configurations on what gulp will do.

You should've downloaded an already created gulpfile.js.
So all you need to do to get started is type in:
gulp

Here are separate command to certain tasks without running
everything.

Enter gulp minify-snowball-css to just minify the css files
Enter gulp minify-snowball-js to just minify the js files

Files in the lib folder will not be compiled.
To minify the css/js libraries, run:
gulp minify-libraries

To minify just the Codemirror library, run the command:
gulp minify-codemirror

To minify just the Codemirror library, run the command:
gulp minify-codemirror

To minify the Codemirror library, run the command:
gulp minify-libraries


========================================================
Zipping Snowball
========================================================
To install your Snowball plugin, you must zip the 
Snowball directory and replace the existing plugin with
the newly created zip folder. 
To zip up Snowball, just run:

gulp zip

and this will create a snowball.zip in your snowball 
directory. Just use this zip file.

========================================================
Git Merge Conflicts for Minified Files
========================================================
If there are merge conflicts for the minified files,
fix the conflicts in the non-minified files first,
then run gulp to minify them all to the version you
want.
